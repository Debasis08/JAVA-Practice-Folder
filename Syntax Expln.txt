class Example
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {....}
}

Expln:- 
- "class" is just an encapsulation of codes. In the name of "class", the codes can define their existence.
- The keyword "public" represents that the main method could be called outside of the class.
- "static" keyword helps the main method to be called before an object of the class is created. Due to "static" the code is called with the "class" name. 
- "void" declares that it will not return anything.
- Rest is to return arguments like to print stuffs.
