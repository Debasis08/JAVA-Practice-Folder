Java Type Casting:- 
------------------

Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.

In Java, there are TWO types of Casting:

Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double

Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte


Operators:- 
------------------

Java divides the operators into the following groups:

Arithmetic operators ( + , - , * , / , % , ++i , --i )
Assignment operators ( = , += , -= , &= , |= , <<= , >>= , ^= )
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Bitwise operators
